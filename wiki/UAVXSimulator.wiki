UAVX from revision R9xx onwards has simple simulation mode to check navigation behaviour including response to stick input, position hold, RTH and altitude hold. The simulator versions of UAVX carry the designation "SIMULATOR" in their hex filename.

The UAVX simple ground-station (UAVXGS) is used to view the response of the aircraft to stick and navigation control. The aircraft must be armed with GPS running. The motors receive no control input during the simulation.

All sensors are expected to be operational during the simulation and failures will be indicated by the UAVXGS status display.

Some sensors are simulated:

  * Compass: simulated using the rudder and navigation inputs.
  * Altimeters: simulated using throttle settings.
  * GPS: The actual origin value is used and outages are modelled but not including bad coordinate values. Coordinates are computed using the desired roll and pitch stick inputs. 

While the full flight dynamics are not computed the behaviour is very similar to what may be expected when in flight.

We seek volunteers to add Google Earth for visualisation.
