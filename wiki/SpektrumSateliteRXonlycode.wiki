#summary Proposal to use the Spektrum satellite Receivers directly.

== Introduction ==
The Mikrokopter has developed code for using only the satellite Rx with a DX6, DX7 and the Futaba and JR TX modules.  We should be able to do the same.

== Details ==
Benefits:  Lighter Rx.  Cost $29. Diversityy 2.4Ghz Rx.

The composite PPM signal would hook up to a pin on the K12 connector.

How to modify the irq.c file: TBD
