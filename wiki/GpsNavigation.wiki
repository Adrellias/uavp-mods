#summary GPS Navigation Status

== Introduction ==

First off, the official UAVP project is also working on adding GPS support. This project is just starting out and GPS navigation is not a trivial matter so Wolferl may just beat us to a working implementation as most of us are just beginners at this.


== What is involved? ==
   * (Done) Choose a GPS unit
      * Etek EB-85A (aka FV-M8) is the recommended GPS unit.
      * Since we plan on supporting NMEA, other GPS units will be supported as well.
      * Available here for about $82: http://www.dpcav.com/xcart/product.php?productid=16161
      * Sometimes available for $55: http://www.ohararp.com/products.html
      * Available here for $99: http://www.sparkfun.com/commerce/product_info.php?products_id=8266
   * Ways forward:
      * Use the 18F2520 PIC instead of the current 876 (See AlternateFirmware): This is the approach that is the farthest along.
      * Use the existing PIC: This is challenging due to compiler and space restrictions and is currently not being pursued.
      * Use another processor: Other options include an ARM processor, an Atmel processor, etc.
      * Create a daughterboard: This is the approach chosen by the Mikrokopter.
   * Parse NMEA sentences
      * In order to know where we are, we need to be able to read the information given to us by the GPS.
      * NMEA is a textual format that most GPS receivers can output.
         * TODO: Add links to NMEA format here...
      * We need to write some code for the PIC to read the information from the GPS.
   * Add a switch to enable or disable GPS navigation. This will allow us to selectively enable the GPS parsing and navigation routes which will prove very helpful during testing.
   * Add GPS navigation routines.
      * A GPS hold routine will probably be the first step. This will allow us to test navigating in a small area before moving onto larger areas. An added benefit is there is less of a chance of the UAVP running away!
      * More to come later...
