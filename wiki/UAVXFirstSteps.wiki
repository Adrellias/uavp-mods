#summary Brief procedures on how to use UAVX for the first time.

== Introduction ==

DRAFT DRAFT DRAFT DRAFT

This is intended to be a brief introduction to the steps you may wish to take when first using UAVX.

You should NOT use GPS initially regardless of how tempting it may be to do so. 

== Assumptions ==

It is assumed you are:
  * familiar with the use of UAVPSet to setup parameters for UAVP, UAVX's predecessor.
  * you have flown your quadrocopter/tricopter using UAVP with some success.
  * you have read the UAVP manual.
  * you have installed the requisite 18F2620 PIC with associated bootloader.

== Stage 1: without GPS =

Most of this will be familiar to you as the procedure is nearly identical to that you will have used with UAVP.

Using the UAVX capable version of UAVPSet:
  * if you have a GPS DISCONNECT it.
  * load the flight software into your quadrocopter (there many less HEX files to choose from and the one you need should be self evident).
  * select UAVX in the pulldown. 
  * initialise your flight parameters from a saved UAVP V3.15 file or using the Tools->Testsoftware->D command in UAVPSet. 
  * select the Tx/Rx, Gyro and ESCs you are using from the appropriate pulldowns and write the config to parameter set #1. Be aware that the Gear switch is no longer used to switch between paramter set 1 & 2. This is done using stick programming (see below) once UAVX is successfully talking to your Tx/Rx. 
  * As for UAVP use Tools->Testsoftware ensure your the Rx signals are being received correctly. Verify this in the Rx Graphic which now displays in % units.
  * save your parameters to a file. UAVX will accept V3.15 parameter files but files written by UAVX are not compatible with V3.15.
  * initialise the accelerometer neutrals as for UAVP.
  * set up parameter set 2. You will see that many of the parameters are not displayed on the Parameter Set 2 page as these are now common to both parameter sets.
  * ensure that the response of the quadrocopter is acceptable using the normal pre-flight checks. You will see that UAVPSet no longer communicates with UAVX once the quadrocopter is armed. If you need to modify parameters you will need to disarm.
  * fly (at your own risk as always) and tune the various flight parameters as required.
  
== Stage 2: with GPS ==

This is new territory and you will need to do some homework for your location. Read the GPS Navigation page carefully.

Using the UAVX capable version of UAVPSet:
  * Connect your GPS.
  * Set the GPS related parameters (notes below to follow).
  *
