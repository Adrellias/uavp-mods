#summary How to test your compass sensor.

There are at least two ways to test your compass sensor.

The first is to use the SensorTest option in UAVPSet.

The second was recommended by jesolins on rcgroup. It is quoted here:

{{{
Here is a good way to test your compass. Put a 5 in the compass parameter window.
Make changes to the Yaw parameters: P=0, I=-25(* use plus if F&R are CW rotation),
D=0, L=25, IL=2. If it is working correctly, it will hold heading with a little bit of
searching with no yaw gyro input. Because of this test, I now use -15-20 in my Yaw "I"
and the heading holds very well.
