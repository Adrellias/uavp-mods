#summary How to Update the FrSky V2 Receivers

= Introduction =

FrsKy is a relatively new company and their developmental cycle is quite fast with the documentation often lagging.

What follows is not a recommendation of the FrSky products in general but is intended to put in one place information that is currently difficult to find.

== Composite Output ==

While the D8R Rx is not directly compatible with UAVX a recent firmaware release allows it to directly generate composite PPM signals where "All Channels" come out on Ch 8.

The firmware update process is quite easy. You will need:

  * The programming cable which is available from FrSky and should come with the combination kit (http://www.frsky-rc.com/ShowProducts.asp?id=42).

  * The updater frsky-update-lite.

== Process ==



  * Make up a cable as shown in the photo due to RENATOA. Note that the Tx pin is mislabelled on the DR* V2 Rx and is in fact the Tx pin.

  * Connect the signal pins on Ch7 and 8 together using a jumper plug.

  * Connect your adapter cable to the serial adapter cable you received with the Tx module.

  * Power up the Rx. The LEDs should be out.

  * Start up frsky_update_rev11.

  * Select the appropriate COM port for the adapter.

  * Select the firmaware file which is currently fdd_rx_cppm_build110120.frk

  * Select *Download* and when finished select *End*

  * Power down the Rx and remove all cables.

That's it.
