#summary Show me the code!

We currently host two projects.

=== UAVP 3.15 mods ===
The first is a collection of modifications to the original UAVP v3.15 source code. These are released as 3.15modX where X is the modification version. Each version includes all of the modifications in the previous version unless noted otherwise.

3.15mod1:
   * compile.bat - A command line client to ease building the firmware.
   * DEBUG_SENSORS - If using a standard PPM ESC, DEBUG_SENSORS no longer causes the ESCs to beep.

3.15mod2 (hasn't been uploaded yet):
   * Battery latch - Changes the standard low battery alarm to be more forgiving of momentary drops in voltage.

3.15mod3:
   * Do you have ideas? Use the issue tab up above to suggest something!

Code:
   * The code for all of the modifications is kept in SVN trunk.

=== Alternate firmware ===
This project is an alternate firmware that targets the 18F2520 instead of the 17F876. It is as of yet unreleased. More information will be coming later.

Code:
   * See the gke branch.
