#summary Provides an overview of the current recommended mods for all UAVP owners.

Over time the group has come up with a set of recommended modifications. Here's an overview.

   * Upgrade PIC to 18f2620: This provides additional space, allows the use of a better processor, and supports a higher clock rate.
   * Use the unofficial firmware. There's unofficial firmware for both the original processor and the 18f. Both will provide improved flight characteristics, but please remember that these are still considered *experimental*.
