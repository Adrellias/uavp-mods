#summary How to use an unlabeled option to easily test your sensors.

=== Introduction ===

Once you have flashed the PIC with a firmware with DEBUG_SENSORS enabled:
   * Launch UAVPSet
   * In the older versions of UAVPSet go to the unnamed (blank) option in the Tools menu
   * Provide 3/4 throttle. The motors will not spin up if you are using DEBUG_SENSORS firmware (which is needed for this screen to provide you with any output).
   * click on the "Connect / Start" menu item

The order of the trace values for UAVX and later UAVP versions are detailed below.

The above picture is a sample of the output that you may see:
   * The first trace is the absolute heading reading from the compass sensor (if installed)
   * The second two relate to the barometer. 
   * The middle set of traces are the accelerometer outputs.
   * The bottom set of traces are the gyro outputs.

=== Trace numbers ===

  * 1  Heading Error
  * 2  Current Baro Pressure				
  * 3  Roll Rate
  * 4  Pitch Rate
  * 5  Yaw Error
  * 6  Roll Sum/Angle
  * 7  Pitch Sum/Angle
  * 8  Yaw Sum/Angle
  * 9  LR (X) Acceleration
  * 10 FB (Y) Acceleration
  * 11 DU (Z) Acceleration
  * 12 Roll Correction
  * 13 Pitch Correction
  * 14 Desired Throttle
  * 15 Desired Roll 
  * 16 Desired Pitch
  * 17 Desired Yaw
  * 18 Motor Front 
  * 19 Motor Back
  * 20 Motor Left
  * 21 Motor Right
  * 22 Cam Roll Servo
  * 23 Cam Pitch Servo
