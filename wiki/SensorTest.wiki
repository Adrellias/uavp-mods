#summary How to use an unlabeled option to easily test your sensors.

Once you have flashed the PIC with a firmware with DEBUG_SENSORS enabled:
   * Launch UAVPSet
   * go to the unnamed option in the Tools menu
   * Provide 3/4 throttle. The motors will not spin up if you are using DEBUG_SENSORS firmware (which is needed for this screen to provide you with any output).
   * click on the "Connect / Start" menu item

The above picture is a sample of the output that you will see:
   * The first trace is the absolute heading reading from the compass sensor (if installed)
   * The second two relate to the barometer. If you know their exact meaning, please leave a comment!
   * The middle set of traces are the accelerometer outputs.
   * The bottom set of traces are the gyro outputs.
