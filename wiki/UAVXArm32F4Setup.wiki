== Introduction ==

This is the evolving setup page for the Arm version of UAVX. We will try to keep explanations concise. 

First UAVXArm32F4 supports many different airframe types from octocopters, through helis out to conventional aircraft. UAVX has done this for several years. 

To keep it simple I will assume you are flying a quadrocopter (4 motors) in plus(+) mode where one arm points forward.

Pictures and howto video will follow (Ken/Jim;)).
 
==== UAVXArm32F4 Board ====

This is what the board looks like.

=== Step 1 ===

Download the software package from the downloads area and install UAVPset and UAVXGS.

Take all the the shorting links (if any) off the board EXCEPT a link from the Arming pin to the adjacent ground; you need to replace this with an arming switch later.

Connect the adapter lead to the board and then to a USB port on your computer.

Start UAVPSet and check that you have the appropriate COM port selected. 

Connect your board to a 12V supply (use your main battery if you wish).  Connect an ESC BEC lead to M1 - do not connect a motor to the ESC. The Red and Yellow LEDs should be on.

In UAVPSet select Tools->TestSoftware->D or load defaults. Close the test window and select the Read Config icon. The default parameter set should populate the various boxes. There are a lot of parameters most of which you may never have to adjust.

Now use Tools->TestSoftware run the Setup Test.  Read the results and try to make sense of it. At the bottom you will see various alarms. With luck the only alarms will be that you have not calibrated the accelerometer, gyros and magnetometer and the Rx is not working.
 
==== Step 2 (Rx) ====

If you have a a Rx (e.g. FrSky) that supports Compound PPM (CPPM) connect it to Rx1. For CPPM you must specify the number of channels your Rx is receiving using UAVPSet.

If you have an Rx that uses Parallel PPM (PPPM) then connect it to Rx1 up to Rx8 in the order Throttle, Aileron, Elevator, Rudder, Gear, Aux1, Aux2, Aux3. You need a minimum of 7 channels for full functionality.

For PPPM number of channels you have actually connected using UAVPSet. 

You can fly with a minimum of 4 channels Throttle, Aileron, Elevator, Rudder. If you do so then you will have altitude hold but no navigation capability. 

You may re-assign the channels using the selectors in UAVPSet. So if your throttle is on Channel 3 then setup the pulldowns appropriately. 

Your Rx is being powered by the ESC connected to M1 as the centre pins of the Mand Rx pins are connected together. 

Turn on your Tx and run the Setup Test again. If you got lucky the Rx will be OK but as Clint Eastwood said "are you ....". Select Tools->TestSoftware->P (Rx Test)and it will show you what is failing. The throttle channel should be around 5%, Aileron, Elevator and Rudder about 50% and Gear around 10%. 

If the Rx Test passes then close the test software window and select the Tx/Rx setup icon. Double check the controls are behaving sensibly and the endpoints are under 100%.

In writing this an auto configure for the Rx has moved to the top of the list! 

=== Step 3 ===

Mount the board on your favourite frame. Take the props OFF. 

The ARROW on the top of the board must point directly along the forward motor arm. 

Connect up a simple arming switch. The motors should not run even if you have the arming switch on until you get through all of the following steps but think about a Kw of motors all running at around 7000RPM flying around your workshop.

Disconnect the centre lead of all but one of your ESC control leads and make sure it is taped back and insulated. 

Looking down on the aircraft with the front arm pointing away from you. the motors:

  * Front M1
  * Left M2
  * Right M3
  * Back M4

Note: If you plan to run camera gimbals then it is worth considering buying a high current UBEC and connecting that to an unused Rx or M. In that case disconnect all of the BEC centre leads.

Connect up the Rx and UAVPSet as before.

=== Step 4 ===

This is the most critical step in the setup.  





=== Step 3 ===

The convention for UAVX is that the front and back propellors rotate counter clockwise and the left and right propellors clockwise.





=== Motor Connections ===

The assignments for the various configurations are the same as for UAVX so refer to   

 M1-M6 correspond directly with the UAVP K1-K6 motor connections. M5 and M6 are for the camera gimbal.
