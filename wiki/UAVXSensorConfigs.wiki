= Introduction =

This Wiki details the sensors currently supported for each of the major versions of UAVX and UAVXArm.


= UAVXArm =

== Gyros ==

* all 16MHz gyros
* ITG3200

== Accelerometers ==



== IMU Boards


= UAVX 18F2620 PIC @ 40MHz

40MHz is the preferred clock rate for UAVX PIC.

=== PID Update Rate ===

*250 Hz

== Gyros ==

*MLX90609-R2
*ADXRS150/613
*IDG300
*LY530
*ADXRS300/610 Analog Devices
*ITG3200
*MPU6050

== Accelerometers ==

*LIS3L
*ADXL345
*BMA180
*MPU8050

=== Barometer ===

*SMD500 Bosch
*BMP085 Bosch
*MPX4115
*MS5611 Measurement Systems 

=== Compass/Magnetometer ===

HMC5883L Honeywell (preferred)
HMC5843 Honeywell (superseded)
HMC6352 Honeywell (legacy compass but 100KHz I2C)

=== IMU Boards ===

*QuadroUFO MPU6050 ( MPU6050, BMP085 )
*Drotek 10DOF ( ITG3200, BMA180, HMC5883XL, BMP085 )
*FreeIMU ( ITG3200, BMA180, MS5611 )
*SparkFun 6DOF ( ITG3200, ADXL345)
*SparkFun 9DOF Sensor Stick ( ITG3200, ADXL345, HMC5843 )

== UAVX 18F2620 PIC @ 16MHz ==

Notionally superseded with a simple upgrade to 40MHz by replacing the 16MHz crystal with a 10MHz crystal and re-burning the PIC with any 40MHz version of the UAVX firmware after which UAVPset can be used to load further 40MHz versions.

=== PID Update Rate ===

*125 Hz
