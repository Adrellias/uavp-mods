This Wiki details the sensors currently supported for each of the major versions of UAVX and UAVXArm.


= UAVXArm =

== Gyros ==

* all 16MHz gyros
* ITG3200

== Accelerometers ==



== IMU Boards


= UAVX 18F2620 PIC @ 40MHz

== Gyros ==

* all 16MHz gyros
* ITG3200

== Accelerometers ==



== IMU Boards


= UAVX 18F2620 PIC @ 16MHz

Notionally superseded with a simple upgrade to 40MHz by replacing the 16MHz crystal with a 10MHz crystal and re-burning the PIC with any 40MHz version of the UAVX firmware after which UAVPset can be used to load further 40MHz versions.
