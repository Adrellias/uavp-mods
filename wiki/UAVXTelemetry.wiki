= UAVX Telemetry DRAFT =

Needs updating.....refer to source code for now (telemetry.c).

The telemetry formats supported are:

  * none
  * GPS
  * UAVX
  * UAVXFC
  * ArduStation

The desired format is selected in the telemetry pull-down in UAVPSet.

= GPS =

This format simply echoes the characters as they are received from the GPS.

= UAVX & UAVXFC=

This format is specific to the UAVX ground-station programs including UAVXGS. 

UAVX must be armed and receiving valid GPS packets before any telemetry is sent.

Telemetry is sent in binary packets formatted as follows:

  * preamble & sync: for telemetry links with a dc chopper one or more 0x55h characters followed by a 0xffh character to synchronise the receiver.
  * ASCII SOH
  * Length (1): length of the packet in bytes.
  * Type (1): UAVXFlightPacketTag or UAVXNavPacketTag.
  * Data (~50): packet data (byte stuffed).
  * Checksum: a simple parity checksum over the packet fields including Length, Type and data.
  * ASCII EOT 
  * trailing characters including ASCII CR/LF not byte stuffed.

The () indicates the size of the field in bytes. 

UAVX telemetry includes most of the status flags, flight control variables and navigation information. UAVXFC sends only primary stick settings, attitude sensor and motor information and is sent at approximately double the packet rate of the UAVX form.

== ArduStation ==

This simple text based telemetry used by the Ardupilot's handheld ArduStation. See DIYDrones pages. This format will probably lapse.
