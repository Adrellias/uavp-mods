#summary Sensor options, setup, algorithms, etc.

Sensor options:
   * Current preferred sensor is the BMP085 which can be obtained mounted from http://www.quadroufo.com/ This supersedes the original SMD500 also from Bosch.

Setup:
   * Current recommended settings using UAVPSet are TEMP=0, P=4, D=4

Current performance:
   * The BMP085 performance is approx +/- 3ft.
   * The original SMD500 performance is  +/- 10ft.

Current algorithm / future improvements:
   * The BMP085 or SMD500 are automatically detected by the "gke" extensions to UAVP.
   * The better performance of the BMP085 is mainly due to faster updates and associated averaging over several readings.
   * Temperature compensation is not currently used in UAVX as it was found to .
