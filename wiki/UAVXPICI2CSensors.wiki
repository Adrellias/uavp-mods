== I2C Sensor Boards ==

There are a number of single board sensor combinations that are compatible with the UAVP board. One such combination, FreeIMU, uses the same set of sensors as UAVXArm32.

The images below show the expected orientation of these cards. The UAVP board does not need to be modified other than probably adding a socket to the I2C pins previously used by the baro and compass.
