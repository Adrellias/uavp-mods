UAVX PIC V2 and UAVXArm use a direct channel assignment scheme. This Wiki gives the current known channel orders. 

The Rx output channels shown after "connect" must be used for parallel connections from the Rx to the UAVP board. The N/P following this indicates the polarity of signals for composite PPM input.
