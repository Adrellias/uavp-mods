#summary How to compile the UAVP firmware..

= Compiling your firmware using the compile.bat from uavp-mod =

To compile your own firmware:
   * Download the source from the Downloads section.
   * Download the cc5x compiler (http://www.bknd.com/cc5xfree.exe).
   * Run the executable to install the compiler. Install it into c:\program files\microchip\cc5x.
   * Download MPLAB (http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/...eDoc/mp810.zip).
   * Unzip mp810.zip into a temp directory. Run Install_MPLAB_v810.exe.
   * Unzip the uavp source into a newly created directory.
   * Launch a command prompt and cd into that directory.
   * Run: "copy c:\program files\microchip\cc5x\reloc.inc ."
   * Edit compile.bat to match your UAVP. Settings that you can change are labeled at the top of the file. If you are using Profi-UFO-V315-CAM0-ADX300-PPM.hex the defaults will work for your UAVP.
   * Note: compile.bat removes all previously compiled hex files when building so backup any old hex files if you want to build more than one version.
   * Run compile.bat
   * Done! The batch file will show the firmware built at the end of the build process.
